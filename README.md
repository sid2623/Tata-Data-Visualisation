# Tata-Data-Visualisation
Empowering Business with Effective Insights Job Simulation on Forage - August 2022

For this project, I used Tableau to create the required visuals based on the questions provided by the CEO and CMO. Below is an outline of the steps I followed:

### Data Cleanup:
Before beginning the analysis, I cleaned the data by performing the necessary checks to ensure accuracy:
- I applied a conditional formula to ensure that no quantity was below 1 unit. Any records where this condition was not met were excluded from the analysis.
- Similarly, I ensured that the unit price was not below $0 and excluded erroneous records using data transformation techniques.
Once these checks were applied, I ensured that the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

### Visuals Creation:
For each question, I created a separate visual on individual tabs within Tableau:
1. Each tab was named according to the respective question number.
2. I utilized Tableau’s advanced features to develop insightful visualizations tailored to the CEO and CMO’s needs.
3. The final visualizations offer clear insights into the data, helping to answer the key questions asked by the leadership.
